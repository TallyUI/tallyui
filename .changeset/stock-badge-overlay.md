Stock reads use the reconciled overlay (ADR-060) and show how fresh it is. `@tallyui/core` now holds `withStockOverlay` and `getProductStock` (`@tallyui/pos` re-exports them), adds `STOCK_LEVELS_LAST_PASS`, `stockOverlay` and `stockOverlayAsOf` props on `ConnectorProvider`, and a `useProductStock(doc)` hook that returns overlay stock plus `asOf`, or `getStock(doc)` when no overlay is given. `@tallyui/database`: `startStockReconcile` also returns `state$` (`running`, `truncated`, `lastError`, `lastCompletedAt`), `reconcileStock()` resolves with `completedAt`, and each successful pass stores `{ completedAt }` in the `last-pass` local document of `stock_levels`, which `createTallyDatabase` now creates with local documents (apps that create the collection themselves use the new `stockLevelsCollection` config; without local documents a pass rejects with a clear error); a restarted runner seeds `lastCompletedAt` from it. `@tallyui/pos` adds `stockOverlayAsOf$`. `ProductStockBadge` reads stock through `useProductStock` and appends " · as of <time>" when an overlay is given (`showAsOf={false}` hides it).
